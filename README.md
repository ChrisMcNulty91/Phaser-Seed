# Phaser-Seed

Phaser-Seed project with an express.js server

All you need to run this project is have node + npm installed. Most versions of node should come with npm installed if not it requires a seprate install. You can get node [here](http://nodejs.org/)

Once you have node installed clone this repo and navigate into it via a command line. Once you are in the top level directory run the following command    
 
    npm install

This will install express.js version 4.4.3 in the project directory. Now that you have express installed
you will need to run the server to do that run the following command

	  node server.js

You should now be able to access the template at  
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Happy Coding.
